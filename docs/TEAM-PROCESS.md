# Team process

This skill is a test-and-userguide engine, not a full SDLC tool. This playbook wires it into a team
flow (Requirement, Design, Dev, Test, Userguide) and sets out the bridges, boundaries, ownership, and
release gate, so results stay consistent and traceable whoever runs them.

✋ The key boundary: this is the acceptance, exploratory, and documentation pass that a person and
agent run before a release. It is not the deterministic CI regression suite. Keep the two separate
(see section 4).

The solid path is the team's flow. The dotted path is where this skill plugs in: it consumes
Acceptance Criteria and produces both a QA verdict and the user guide from the same run.

## Stage by stage

### 1. Requirement to Acceptance Criteria (the Design bridge)
- Every requirement or ticket becomes one or more Acceptance Criteria in Given/When/Then form.
- Acceptance Criteria are the objective source of what must be true. They catch missing-feature bugs
  that code-based test design cannot, since you can't derive a test for code that was never written.
- Record the ticket id. It flows all the way to the guide.

### 2. Design (test design)
- Feed both the Acceptance Criteria and the code into
  [`../references/test-design.md`](../references/test-design.md): the AC drive the happy and
  functional coverage; the code drives the branch, edge, and adversarial coverage the AC don't spell out.
- Use its ✅ in-browser vs. ⚠️ code-only split as a contract with Dev (see section 3).

### 3. Dev (what belongs where)
| Concern | Owner | Where it's tested |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Rendered UI: forms, navigation, visual, error surfacing | QA (this skill) | `flow.yaml` scenarios |
| ⚠️ Logic boundaries, race/concurrency, governance, SQL, rollback | Dev | unit / integration tests |

The ⚠️ code-only rows in `test-design.md` are not covered by the browser. Dev must cover them, and the
QA report should cite them as verified by dev tests or unverified in browser, never marked Pass.

### 4. Test (two distinct roles, kept separate)
| | agent-browser-qa | CI regression suite (Playwright/Cypress) |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | before a release, person + agent | every commit, headless, deterministic |
| Goal | acceptance, exploratory, and docs | fast pass/fail gate, no flakiness tolerated |
| Environment | dev machine (Windows cold-start / 10060 realities) | clean CI runner |
| Output | qa-report.md, user guide, bug reports | red/green |

Do not turn `flow.yaml` runs into the CI suite. The gotchas (ffmpeg, session stalls, os 10060) are
single-machine realities that make it flaky in CI. A stable subset of flows can be ported to
Playwright for CI, but that is a separate, deterministic artifact.

### 5. Userguide (regenerate every release)
The guide comes from a real run, so it is only correct for the UI at run time. A UI change silently
invalidates it. Put "regenerate the guide" on the release checklist rather than treating it as a
one-time task.

---

## Release gate

A release is blocked until:
1. Every Acceptance Criterion maps to a scenario that actually ran (no "not tested" on an AC).
2. The adversarial pass ran, not just smoke, for the changed areas.
3. No Critical or High severity bug is open. Medium and Low may ship with a tracked ticket.
4. The user guide was regenerated if any covered UI changed.

Severity guide: Critical is data loss, wrong money, or security. High is a core AC broken with no
workaround. Medium is an AC that works but only with a workaround. Low is cosmetic.

## Ownership (RACI)

| Activity | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Write Acceptance Criteria | BA / PO | PO | Dev, QA | Team |
| Dev unit/integration (code-only rows) | Dev | Tech Lead | QA | - |
| Author `flow.yaml` and run QA | QA (+ agent) | QA Lead | Dev | PO |
| Review `qa-report.md` | Tech Lead | QA Lead | Dev | PO |
| Release gate sign-off | QA Lead | PO | Tech Lead | Team |
| Regenerate user guide | QA (+ agent) | QA Lead | - | Support / PO |

## Artifacts and where they live

Version QA artifacts with the feature, in the app repo, not on one person's machine:
```
<app-repo>/qa/<feature>/
  flow.yaml            # scenarios with requirement + acceptance
  run-log.json         # batch --json output (audit trail)
  baseline/            # visual-regression baselines (versioned)
  shots/               # per-step screenshots
  qa-report.md         # verdict + severity, cites ticket ids
  guide/               # generated user guide (regenerated per release)
```
This keeps coverage auditable, since the requirement, scenario, report, and guide all carry the same
ticket id, and it lets anyone re-run or diff a flow.
