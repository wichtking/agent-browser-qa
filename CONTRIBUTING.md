How to change this skill without breaking the discipline it is built on. New here? Read
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) first for the mental model, then this file for the loop.

## Prerequisites

- [`agent-browser`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) on PATH + Chrome for Testing
  (`agent-browser install`) — needed to run `self-test/smoke-test.sh`.
- Python 3.10+ with PyYAML: `pip install -r requirements.txt` — for the `scripts/`.
- Optional: `pymupdf` (for `self-test/pdf/pdf-test.sh`), `ffmpeg` (only if you touch the video recipe).

## The change loop

Most edits change or add a **claim** — a statement about how agent-browser behaves, a gotcha, a
recipe, a token/efficiency number. The loop keeps a claim honest:

```
1. edit the source        references/<file>.md (detail) and/or SKILL.md (if it's a golden rule)
2. add/adjust a check      self-test/ — a claim ships with a reproducible check, not an anecdote
3. record provenance       docs/CLAIMS-AUDIT.md — a row: measured / verified-by-A/B / inferred / version-pinned
4. run self-test           bash self-test/smoke-test.sh  (+ pdf/pdf-test.sh if PDF-related)
5. ship                    issue-first → branch → PR → squash-merge (see "Git flow")
```

Not every edit is a claim (fixing a typo, tightening wording). But anything that asserts a behavior
or a number goes through steps 2–3 — that is what separates this repo from a pile of tips.

### Editing SKILL.md vs a reference

`SKILL.md` is loaded into context on **every** skill trigger; `references/*.md` load **on demand**.
So keep `SKILL.md` lean: a golden rule + a pointer, with the full detail in the reference. Do not
copy a reference's content up into `SKILL.md`. When in doubt, measure — this repo counts tokens with
`tiktoken` rather than estimating.

### Adding a self-test check

Two kinds live in `self-test/smoke-test.sh`:
- **Browser checks** drive a real agent-browser against `self-test/smoke-page.html` (e.g. "`click`
  does not auto-scroll"). Use `chk "name" "expected-substr" "actual"`.
- **Pure-file checks** need no browser (e.g. the PDF-template scoped-read gate). Prefer these for
  anything measurable from files — they stay green even where the browser harness can't run.

Verify a new check actually runs (`bash -n` for syntax, then run it) before shipping it. Document it
in `self-test/README.md`.

### Updating the claims ledger

`docs/CLAIMS-AUDIT.md` is the ledger of what is proven vs assumed. When you add or change a claim,
add or update its row with honest provenance:
- **measured** — a number you produced with a tool (cite it, e.g. "tiktoken o200k_base").
- **verified (A/B)** — reproduced with a controlled before/after.
- **inferred** — a causal claim you believe but did not A/B; say so, don't promote it to fact.
- **version-pinned** — true for a specific agent-browser / Chrome version; re-verify on a bump.

## Running the checks

```bash
bash self-test/smoke-test.sh      # syntax/recipe/reproducible claims + efficiency gates
bash self-test/pdf/pdf-test.sh    # PDF pagination A/B (needs pymupdf + network for paged.js CDN)
```

Re-run after any agent-browser or Chrome version bump — this is the drift detector.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/build-skill.py` | Zips `SKILL.md` + `assets/` + `references/` + `examples/` + runtime scripts into `agent-browser-qa.skill` (a git-ignored build artifact). | `python scripts/build-skill.py` |
| `scripts/coverage-check.py` | Release gate as an exit code: reads a `qa/<feature>/coverage.yaml` and returns 0 (pass) / 1 (fail) / 2 (malformed). | `python scripts/coverage-check.py qa/<feature>/coverage.yaml` |
| `scripts/release-summary.py` | Rolls every `qa/*/coverage.yaml` into one sign-off table, reusing the gate logic. | `python scripts/release-summary.py [qa_dir]` |

## Cutting a release

1. Land all changes on `main` via PRs.
2. `python scripts/build-skill.py` — rebuild `agent-browser-qa.skill`.
3. Tag + release, attaching the bundle (SemVer; docs/optimization = minor, fixes = patch):
   ```bash
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --target main --title "vX.Y.Z — <summary>" \
     --notes "<what changed>" agent-browser-qa.skill
   ```
   The README's release badge is dynamic and updates itself once the release is the latest.

## Git flow

- This repo has a GitHub remote, so every change is **issue-first**: open an issue, branch
  (`docs/<n>-slug`, `feat/<n>-slug`, `fix/<n>-slug`), PR with `Closes #<n>`, squash-merge.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `docs:`, `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`,
  `chore:`, `refactor:`.
- Keep changes surgical — every changed line should trace to the issue.
